### main.rs
It launches the program <br>
It calls the CLI parser `cli.rs`, then sends to the right commands (commands/...)

### cli.rs
**It reads the arguments that the user types into the terminal (gust init, gust commit...)** <br>
Informs `main.rs` which command was invoked.
> ðŸ§  Think of it as the interpreter between the user and the code.
---

### The commands folder
It contains all the actions the user will perform, all the commands the user will use, and is where the functions created in the `core folder` will be used <br>
Each file corresponds to a command: init, add, commit...
> ðŸ§  It's like buttons on a machine: each button triggers a specific behavior

### The core folder
Contains generic, reusable logic: create Git objects, calculate hashes, manage indexes...<br>
**Never talk to the terminal! Just business functions**
> ðŸ§  It's like the machine's internal engine

### The terminal folder
It contains everything about **the TUI - Ratatui** <br>
This is where you call up and configure the commands you created earlier.
> ðŸ§  This is the graphical part of the project
---
### Summary
>`main.rs` is the controller, `cli.rs` analyzes user commands, `commands/` executes actions, and `core/` contains the real technical building blocks. <br>
Everything is modular, testable and easy to evolve.
